# Deploying the FRDR Encryption App

These instructions are for repository owners interested in building and deploying a custom version of the FRDR Encryption App for their own use.

## Encrypted Dataset Deposit Workflow

1. Encrypt

* The depositor logs into the encryption app
* The depositor uses the encryption app to encrypt the source data

2. Deposit

* The depositor logs into the data repository
* The depositor starts a new dataset submission
* The depositor supplies all relevant metadata for the dataset
* The depositor uploads the encrypted data package
* The repository curation process is executed and the dataset is published

3. Request access

* The requester finds the published dataset and starts the process to request access
* The requester supplies all required documentation and agreements
* The requester signs the data access agreement

4. Email notification

* The depositor receives email that the requester wants access
* The depositor reviews all documentation and signs the data access agreement

5. Grant access to encrypted data

* The depositor grants the requester access to the encrypted data package within the repository

In order to support the Encryption App operation, a REST API will need to be built within the data repository.  These endpoints are used in `FRDRAPIClient.py`:

* `/requestitem/grant-access/verify`
* `/dataset-title`
* `/uservaultid`
* `/requestitem/decrypt`
* `/requestitem/grant-access`
